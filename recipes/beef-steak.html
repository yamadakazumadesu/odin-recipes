        <h2>Steps for making Spaghetti</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate beef in soy sauce, lemon (or calamansi), and ground black pepper for at least 1 hour. Note: marinate overnight for best result</li>
                <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan then pan-fry half of the onions until the texture becomes soft. Set aside</li>
                <li>Drain the marinade from the beef. Set it aside. Pan-fry the beef on the same pan where the onions were fried for 1 minute per side. Remove from the pan. Set aside</li>
                <li>Add more oil if needed. Saute garlic and remaining raw onions until onion softens.</li>
                <li>Pour the remaining marinade and water. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add beef. Cover the pan and simmer until meat is tender. Note: Add water as needed.</li>
                <li>Season with ground black pepper and salt as needed. Top with pan-fried onions.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve hot. Share and Enjoy!</li>
